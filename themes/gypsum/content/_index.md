# What is Gypsum?

Gypsum is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for Hugo. It is inspired (but not a derivative of) [Alabaster](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/), the highly popular theme for Sphinx. 

## Features

* Clean, minimalist design
* Light, but configurable design

# Project background

Gypsum aims to be a middle ground between Alabaster, the original [krTheme](https://github.com/kennethreitz-archive/kr-sphinx-themes) and some of the lighter themes available for Hugo. Much of the visual inspiration is also derived from the theme used for [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com).
